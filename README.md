# Job Search System

## Overview
The **Job Search System** is designed to facilitate job searching and applications for candidates while allowing employers to post job listings. The system features a robust filtering mechanism for job searches based on various criteria, ensuring that candidates find positions that match their preferences and qualifications. Additionally, all user information is persistently saved, allowing seamless access even after the program has ended, thanks to the use of text files. Communication between employers and candidates is streamlined, enabling job applications, application rejections, status checks, and resume submissions.

## Features
- **Advanced Job Search**: Candidates can search for jobs using multiple filtering criteria, including job type, working hours, profession, experience level, location, and more.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: User profiles, job listings, and application statuses are saved in text files, ensuring data is not lost when the program terminates.
- **Employer-Candidate Interaction**: Employers can view candidate profiles, manage applications, and communicate independently through provided contact details.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository using:
